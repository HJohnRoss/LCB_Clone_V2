Given your current three-project setup (
Api, Shared, Web) and your goal for a clean, professional structure in 2025, you should move toward a Vertical Slice organization. This pattern keeps related code together, making it easier to maintain as your project grows. 
1. The 2025 Recommended Structure
Refactor your current folders into this optimized layout:
text

LCB_Clone/
├── src/
│   ├── LCB_Clone.Api/          # Entry point, DI registration, & Middleware
│   │   ├── Features/           # Core logic grouped by BUSINESS FEATURE
│   │   │   ├── Users/          # Everything for the "User" feature in one spot
│   │   │   │   ├── UserEndpoints.cs    # Route definitions (Minimal API groups)
│   │   │   │   ├── CreateUser.cs       # Combined Command, Handler, & Validator
│   │   │   │   └── UserMappings.cs     # Mapping logic for this feature
│   │   ├── Infrastructure/     # Cross-cutting technical concerns
│   │   │   ├── Persistence/    # DbContext, Migrations, & Configurations
│   │   │   └── Middleware/     # Global Error Handling
│   │   └── Program.cs          # Keep this thin with extension methods
│   │
│   ├── LCB_Clone.Shared/       # CONTRACTS shared between API and Web
│   │   ├── DTOs/               # API Request/Response records (e.g., UserResponse)
│   │   └── Constants/          # Shared enums or magic strings
│   │
│   ├── LCB_Clone.Web/          # Blazor project (stays mostly as is)
│
├── tests/                      # SEPARATE project for all test types
│   └── LCB_Clone.Api.Tests/

Use code with caution.
2. Specific Improvements for Your Structure

    Decouple Endpoints and Logic: Move the "query logic" out of your current Endpoints/ folder. In a Vertical Slice approach, your endpoint should simply call a handler (e.g., using MediatR) that executes the logic.
    Thin Out Program.cs: Use extension methods in a ServiceExtensions class to register your services (e.g., builder.Services.AddProjectDatabases()), keeping your entry point readable.
    Shared Project Usage: Ensure your Shared project only contains contracts (DTOs) and not your database entities. This prevents your database structure from being leaked to your Blazor frontend.
    Centralize Persistence: Group your AppDbContext and Migrations under an Infrastructure/Persistence/ folder to separate the database technicalities from your business features. 

3. Essential 2025 "Add-ons"
To make the API truly robust, implement these three patterns:

    Global Exception Handling: Add a Middleware/ErrorHandlerMiddleware.cs to catch all errors and return a standard ProblemDetails response instead of using scattered try-catch blocks.
    FluentValidation: Move your validation logic into separate Validator classes (e.g., CreateUserValidator.cs) within your feature folders to keep your models clean.
    Observability: Add a HealthChecks endpoint (e.g., /health) so external tools can monitor if your database and API are running.
